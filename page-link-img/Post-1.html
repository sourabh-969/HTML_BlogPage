                                    <font size="5">While the terms "anime" and "cartoon" are often used interchangeably,
                                        there's a subtle
                                        distinction: <br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Anime:</strong> &nbsp;Specifically refers to animation
                                                originated from Japan,
                                                characterized by its distinct art style, often
                                                featuring large, expressive eyes and exaggerated proportions.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Cartoon:</strong> &nbsp;A broader term encompassing all types of
                                                animation, including
                                                anime, regardless of origin or style.</li>
                                        </ul> <br>
                                        So, while all anime is cartoon, not all cartoons are anime

                                </p>

                                    <font size="5"> In simple terms, anime refers to Japanese animation, which has been
                                        around since the
                                        early 20th century when the first
                                        animators emerged. Anime often complements Manga (Japanese comic books) by
                                        adapting their stories
                                        into animated
                                        television series. <br>
                                        One of the most famous anime shows is PokÃ©mon, which has achieved global
                                        recognition. Each anime
                                        artist has a unique
                                        style, and the stories are often influenced by Japanese history. Several
                                        animated films havereceived
                                        prestigious awards,
                                        such as an Academy Award for the movie Spirited Away. </font>

                                        Anime â€“ as we shall still call it that, for ease â€“ started, people say, in the
                                        late 1910s, when a
                                        number of
                                        painters,cartoonists, and political caricaturists became interested in working
                                        with animated images.
                                        <br><br>
                                        These guys were working off the back of European and US influence, and the same
                                        can be said of the
                                        big breakthrough in
                                        Japanese anime in the 1960s. This came, pretty much, with the celebrated Osamu
                                        Tezuka, whose works
                                        â€“like Astro Boy and
                                        Princess Knight â€“ were heavily influenced by the popularity of Disneyâ€™s movies
                                        from the thirties.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Remember that name, Tezuka â€“ because it was him who really defined the style
                                        that we know today as
                                        â€˜typicallyâ€™ anime or
                                        manga. Thatâ€™s the large eyes â€“ able to express all sorts of emotional depth â€“
                                        and the wacky hair.
                                        <br><br>
                                        After this, anime and manga boomed â€“ throughout the seventies and into the
                                        eighties. Classics like
                                        Space Battleship
                                        Yamato and Mobile Suit Gundam were early favourites, whilst hugely influential
                                        works like the film
                                        NausicaÃ¤ of the
                                        Valley of the Wind and Dragon Ball came later on. <br><br>
                                        The first of these gave Japanese animation a global audience â€“ and transformed
                                        the image of anime
                                        from a sub-cultural
                                        trend into an art form with really profound possibilities. If weâ€™re identifying
                                        the moments at which
                                        anime became hugely
                                        culturally influential, this was one of them. People all around the world began
                                        to watch anime â€“ and
                                        people of all ages
                                        too.<br><br>
                                        However, when Neon Genesis Evangelion arrived in 1995, it emerged during a bit
                                        of a slump for the
                                        form. The eighties
                                        were a difficult decade economically for Japan, and, as a result, the anime
                                        industry had struggled.
                                        Evangelion changed
                                        this â€“ and it became a bit of a sensation, influencing the next decade of anime
                                        productions.
